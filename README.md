# Autostitch: Panorama Stitching Using ORB and RANSAC

In this project, I developed a system to merge a series of horizontally overlapping photographs into a single, seamless panoramic image. Using Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) feature detector and descriptor, I tried to detect distinct features within each image and identify corresponding features in the overlapping regions of other images.

Next, I employed the RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm to automatically align the photographs, determining their overlap and relative positions. Once the images were aligned, I blended them together to create a single panoramic image. The project workflow consisted of several steps visualized through the AutostitchUI interface, a graphical interface that allowed me to view the intermediate results at various stages of the process, which operated on the images and intermediate results to produce the final panoramic output. The detailed steps required to create a panorama involved implementing two methods for stitching: one using translations (where I pre-spherically warped the input images) and another using homographies, where I aligned the input images directly. The steps in square brackets applied only to the spherical warping method.

First, I captured a series of overlapping photographs using a tripod or handheld camera. For the translation method, I preprocessed the images by warping them to spherical coordinates. Using ORB, I detected and extracted distinctive features from each image, and then found and matched corresponding features between overlapping images. I used RANSAC to robustly estimate the transformation between image pairs, aligning them correctly. After recording the relative translations between neighboring images, I adjusted the alignment to minimize accumulated errors (drift) across the sequence of images. Finally, I loaded the images and blended them into a single seamless panorama, cropped any extraneous parts from the final panorama, and imported it into a viewer for display.

To aid my understanding I found AutostitchUI to be an invaluable tool as it allowed me to visualize intermediate results and debug my process effectively. By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience with feature detection, feature matching, robust alignment using RANSAC, image blending, and the practical implementation of panoramic image stitching. This project not only reinforced theoretical concepts but also enhanced my problem-solving and coding skills in a real-world application.
